  Staying anonymous isn't as easy as it once was. When all of our lives are online, we can't hide by closing the curtains or changing cities anymore. 
  Every move we make on the web leaves a digital footprint, and every digital footprint contains information that points to our likes, dislikes, habits, and routines. 
  While anonymous authorship was once commonplace, remaining truly anonymous in the internet era is a challenge, especially if people are intent on discovering who you are.

  <p>
  Against all odds, The Anime Central blogger is an anonymous author whose name remains a mystery.
